The Simple Injector weblog is where we—the Simple Injector contributors—will write about Simple Injector, Dependency Injection, best practice and software design in general.

Simple Injector is strongly opinionated, and so are we; we love talking about software design and principles and from now on we’ll be doing it right here.

We'll keep you updated about new Simple Injector features, releases, background stories and anything else we decide to write about.

Welcome to The Simple Injector Blog!
